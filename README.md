# Google-Sheet-1.0

Here are some of the standout features of my Excel clone:
1️⃣ Multiple Sheets: Users can create and manage multiple sheets,
2️⃣ Cell Customization: Each cell can have unique properties across sheets.
3️⃣ Copy, Cut, and Paste: You can seamlessly copy, cut, and paste data within and across different sheets, just like in the real Excel.
4️⃣ Download and Upload Sheets: The ability to download and upload sheets
5️⃣ Complex Formulas: One of the most exciting features is the ability to create cells value based on formulas using Graph algorithm which edits itself even after copy/cut pasting.
6️⃣ Cycle Detection for Formula: The Excel clone includes a cycle detection feature. If a cycle is formed while updating cells using a formula, the system will immediately alert you, highlighting where the cycle has occurred. This ensures data accuracy and prevents errors
